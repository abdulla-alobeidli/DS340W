Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n### 1.1 The Premier League <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1.1\"></a>\nThe Premier League, often referred outside England as the `English Premier League or the EPL for short`, is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League)]\n\n### 1.2 The Dataset <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1.2\"></a>\n\nThe [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rishikeshkanabar/premier-league-player-statistics-updated-daily) is correct upto and including 2020-09-24 (a lot has has happen since then, notebook will be updated when the dataset gets an update). Each row in the data represents a football player currently playing in the EPL and the columns are featured used to discribe players' data and game statistics. There are 571 rows and 59 columns in the data. Few of the columns are:\n\n* Name: Name of the player\n* Jersey Number: Number at the back of his shirt\n* Club: Club the player plays for at present\n* Position: Playing position(Goalkeeper, Defender, Mid-fider, Forward)\n* Nationality: Country the player is from\n* Age: Players age\n* Appearances: Number of games played (a substitute appearance aslo counts)\n* Wins: Number of games the palyer has won\n* Losses: Number of games the palyer has lost\n* Goals: Number of goals the player has scored in the EPL \n* Goals per match: Goals scored per game, etcetra.\n\n\n**Notes** : \n\n1. A player's attributes from previous premier league clubs are carried to his current club. \n2. When all-time stats are considered, obviously longevity in the game plays a big role. The longer the player has played in the EPL, the higher the stats (counts of something) are going to be. Hence the *per-game* stat will be a better indicator of performance. On the other hand players who played too few games might appear as top-performers. For this reason only players who played at least 38 games are considered (a full-season's worth of games) in the per-game comparison.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from itertools import repeat\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd \npd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-27T14:26:47.99038Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-27T14:26:47.990714Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-27T14:26:47.99775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-27T14:26:47.990686Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-27T14:26:47.996721Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/premier-league-player-statistics-updated-daily/dataset -

The majority of the players are English. Other UK member countries will also likely have more representations. The question is which country comes next? The first thing that can be a factor is geographyical proximity. What comes after that would be likely to be determined by talent baring workpermit issue and visa-related challenges that could prevent some players from playing/working in the EPL.

Players Stats By Playing Position <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n### 3.1 Goalkeepers  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3.1\"></a>\n\nOne of the key stats for goalkeepers is the much coveted `clean sheet` (conceeding zero goals in a game). Although this stat is not entierly dependent on the performance/ability of the goalkeeper only (a solid defence-line infront of a goalkeeper always helps), this metric shows how good a goal keeper is. The goalkeeper who kept the most clean sheets is awarded a golden-glove for thier effort at the end of a season. Other important qualities of a goalkeeper are:\n\n*  Clean sheets\n*  Saves\n*  Penalties saved \n*  Punches \n*  High Claims \n*  Catches\n\n**Extra info**: \nMost Expensive goal keepers in the EPL are:\n1. Kepa Arrizabalaga (SPN), Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea in 2018, £71m\n2. Alisson Becker (BRA), AS Roma to Liverpool in 2018, £65m\n3.

That means defend well and do not concede a goal. For that to happen derenders play a huge part. Good defenders are able to read the game very well and sense where the danger is in time. They know when to join the party (attacking) or sit back and defend. Although they are rare to find, there are defenders who can do more than their own job by assisting goals and scoring themselves as well. Let's see who are the best defenders at doing their job and who are contributing more than they are needed to.\n\n**Extra info**:\nMost expensive defender in the EPL:\n1. Harry Maguire (Leicester City to Manchester United) - €87million\n2. Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool) - €84.65 million\n3. Joao Cancelo (Juventus to Manchester City) - €65 million\n\nContrary to the transfer fees, big Virgil is the best defender in the list, if not in the world (of course my opinion) \n\n[Here is the

It is an interactive and customizable library with several option to choose from. \n- However, I was slightly dissapointed that the dataset was not updated to include the games until the end of the full season 2020/21.
